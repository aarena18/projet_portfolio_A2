# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO - YEAR 2 -

**Hello there! ~**
here you'll be able to see how I built a portfolio from scratch :)

## WHY THIS PROJECT?

> As a junior developer, I was asked to create a plateform that would allow me to showcase other projects that I've done by the past or the ones in construction; hence this idea. To make it, I went through several phases: searching for new designs, new techniques and eventually decided to follow the direction that represented me the most.

## INSTALLATION

If you want to use this project, perhaps because you needed some inspiration or else, you'll need to download it and then make changes direclty on the code files.

## DEPLOYEMENT

In order to deploy this project, I used vercel, which is a great tool that works with github, and automatically deploys your project.
On top of that, I activated the "running checks" function.

## OTHERS & APPS

If you want to fully use this project, you'll have to install -scss on your device and know the bases of -html and -js.
To help you, I adivse you install (just like I did) Imgbot and codefactor.io through github marketplace.
